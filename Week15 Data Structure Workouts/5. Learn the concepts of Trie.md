<h1>Trie</h1>

Trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing dynamic sets or associative arrays (objects in js), where the keys are usually strings.

Each node is linked to the next character string.
Tries are efficient for tasks like string matching, autocomplete, and dictionary implementations.
