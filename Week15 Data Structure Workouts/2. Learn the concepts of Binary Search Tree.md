<h1>Binary Search Tree. </h1>

A Binary Tree is a tree data structure which has at most 2 children.
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure in which all the elements in the left subtree are smaller and in the right are larger.
The time complexity of the operations are O(log n). Because at each step, search space is effectively halved due to the nature of the tree.
