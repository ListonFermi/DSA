<h1>Heap</h1>

Heap is a specialised tree-based data structure.
Value of each node is less than or equal to the child nodes in case of min heap and greater than or equal to incase of max heap.
Heaps are commonly used for extracting max or min values in logarithmic time. 
They are used for extracting the most important values quickly, making heaps valuable in making priority queues.
