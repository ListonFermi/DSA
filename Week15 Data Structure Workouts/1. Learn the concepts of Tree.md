Tree DS:
Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the data in a form of trees.
Each node is connected to the other nodes with only one link. 
Each node can have zero or more children.
Top node is called hierarchy and the nodes without children are called leaves.

Terms:
Root- The top node of the tree
Edge- The link which connects the nodes
Parent Node
Child Node
Siblings
Leaf Node- The outermost node with no branches

Types of Tree DS:
Binary Tree
Ternary Tree
K-nary Tree
N-ary Tree

Other Trees:
AVL Tree : Self balancing BST. Balance factor(Ht diff b/w left and right nodes) is at most 1.
Red black tree :Self balancing BST. Each node is assigned a color red/black.

Application of trees:
>File Systems
>Compression algorithms
>HTML DOM
>Version Control system
