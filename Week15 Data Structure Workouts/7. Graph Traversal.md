<h1>Graph Traversal</h1>

The process of systematically visiting all the vertices and edges of a graph is called graph traversal.

It can be done by DFS and BFS:

DFS: Start at vertex, visit as far as possible before backtracking. Uses stack or recursion.
BFS: Start at vertex, visit all the neighbors before moving on to neighbors of the neighbors. Uses a queue.
