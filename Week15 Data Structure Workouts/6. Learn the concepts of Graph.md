<h1>Graph</h1>

Graph is a data structure with collection of nodes/vertices connected with edges.
Edges can also be weighted or unweighted providing magnitude of the edge.
Edges can also be directed or undirected.
The neighbours of each vertices can be stores in a list like structure called adjacency list or 
in a 2d array called adjacency matrix.

Directed Graphs
Undirected Graphs

More types:

Adjacency Lists representation:
Pros:
>Storage wise more efficient:  Need not store values for edges which doesn't exist like adjacency matrix
>Finding adjacent nodes: Big-O=O(1) . In adjacency matrix: Big-O=O(n) 
>Extra values like weight of edge can be saved in adjacent lists unlike adjacency matrix

Weight of edge means the magnitude of the edge which provides extra data.
