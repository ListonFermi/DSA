Graph DS:


Directed Graphs
Undirected Graphs

More types:


Implementation:
Adjacency  Matrix

Adjacent Lists representataion:
Pros:
>Storage wise more efficent:  Need not store values for edges which doesn't exist like adjaceny martix
>Finding adjacent nodes: Big-O=O(1) . In adjacency matrix: Big-O=O(n) 
> Extra values like weight of edge can be saved in adjacent lists unlike adjacency matrix

Weight of edge means the magnitude of the edge which provides extra data.
