Learn the concepts of the Linked list. Complete at least three sample workouts
a.Construction of Singly linked list & Doubly linked list.
b.Convert array to a linked list
c.Add a node at the end & beginning
d.Delete node with the value specified
e.Insert a node after & before a node with x data
f.Print all elements by order & reverse by order
g.Write a program to remove duplicates in a sorted singly linked list


A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below :
Singly Linkedlist without tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]
Singly Linkedlist with tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT,TAIL]
Doubly Linkedlist with tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT,PREVIOUS]->[VALUE,NEXT,PREVIOUS]->[VALUE,NEXT,TAIL,PREVIOUS]
