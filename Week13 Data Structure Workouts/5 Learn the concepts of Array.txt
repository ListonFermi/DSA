Array is a datastructure that stores multiple items under a singe variable name.
In javascript array can contain mix of several datatypes.
Each values is stored with an index value so that the variable can be accessed easily using its index.

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below :
Singly Linkedlist without tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]
Singly Linkedlist with tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT]->[VALUE,NEXT,TAIL]
Doubly Linkedlist with tail: [HEAD,VALUE,NEXT,PREVIOUS]->[VALUE,NEXT,PREVIOUS]->[VALUE,NEXT,TAIL,PREVIOUS]
