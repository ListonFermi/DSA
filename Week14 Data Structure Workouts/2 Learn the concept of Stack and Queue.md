Learn the concept of Stack and Queue. Complete at least three sample workouts in each of them &
do at least 3 problems from any competitive coding websites (Hacker Rank, Code Chef, Leet code, Algo Expert, etc.)
PUSH, POP and Display elements in Stack 
Enqueue, Dequeue and Display elements in Queue.

Stack Data Structure:
Stack is a data structure that has sequential collection of data which follows the principle of LIFO-Last In Fast Out.
Stack usage:
JS Callstack

Queue Data Structure:
Queue is a data structure that has sequential collection of data which follows the principle of FIFO- First In First Out.
[front or head]---[]--[]--[]--[rear or tail]
Queue usage:
Callback Queue in JS runtime

Abstract Data types: defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model.

Enqueue: adds element to rear or tail
Dequeue: adds element to front or head

Circular Queue:
The size of the Circular Queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used.
The front end is connected to the last element.
It is also called 'Ring buffer' or 'Circular buffer' and also follows the FIFO principle- First in First Out

Same operations as normal Queue: Enqueue and Dequeue.
Circular Queue usage:
Clock,
Streaming data, 
Traffic lights
